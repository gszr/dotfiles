# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  TERM: alacritty

  # to the window manager's recommended size
